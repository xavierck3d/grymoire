# Currency

Precious metals as currency fell out of fashion almost as soon as glyph crystals and their inherent power were discovered.

Glyph crystals are traded by weight, regardless of the condition of the crystal. Even if a crystal has been ground to dust, it still has the same value – though it would need to be reconstituted for it to have any magical use.

The basic unit of currency is the gram, usually shortened to a small g. One gram of crystal would pay for a hot meal or lodging for a night in a small city. Any amount smaller than a gram is referred to as a pinch, and is usually only accepted by street vendors for cheap items such as food or toys. A pinch may be anything from a small shard of crystal to a literal pinch of powder.

Crystal weighs about 1 gram per cubic centimeter.
