# Equipment

There are many types of equipment available to player characters. Some of this equipment consists of mundane, every-day items which can be found and purchased nearly anywhere. Some rarer equipment is magical, having been imbued with properties from spells which increase the effectiveness of the item and grant the bearer new powers and abilities.
