# Armor

Armor comes in three varieties: light, medium, and heavy.

### Armor Training

Creatures who are untrained in effective use of medium and heavy armor are hampered by it, reducing their body and power stats by 1 while wearing it.

Armor training can be acquired by wearing and using a type of armor for at least a week unaided, or 4 days with aid from a person who already has the required training.

### Light Armor

Light armor provides a degree of protection from short falls, bludgeoning, stabbing, and slashing, and gives the wearer some minor protection from weather and the environment. Light armor generally consists of heavy canvas, stiff leather, or sometimes even slats of wood or bone. Light armor fits over most clothing aside from long cloaks and dresses. Light armor generally does not include metal pieces aside from buckles and buttons.

Light armor grants +1 to your resilience stat while being worn.

Light armor can be worn by all sizes of creatures.

| **Type** | **Cost** | **Weight** | **Properties** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bone** | 70g | 5kg | Elemental Resistance - Fire |
| **Leather** | 55g | 5kg | **Stiff**. -1m to all movement |
| **Padded** | 40g | 4kg | **Warm**. +1d6 to checks against freezing |
| **Wood** | 50g | 10kg | **Noisy**. -1d6 to challenges related to sneaking |

### Medium Armor

Medium armor tends to be more effective than light armor at protecting against stabbing, slashing, and blunt force. Additionally, medium armor has an added layer of padding underneath. It does not fit over any except the scantest clothing.

Because of the extra padding underneath medium armor, it is generally excellent at protecting its wearer from weather and environmental hazards such as snow or desert heat.

Medium armor generally consists of a layer of padded cloth underclothes cinched together at the joints, and layers of thick canvas, leather, or chainmail.  


Medium armor grants +2 to your resilience stat while being worn.

Medium armor can only be worn by medium and large characters.

Medium armor reduces running speed by 1m and swimming speed by 2m.

| **Type** | **Cost** | **Weight** | **Properties** |

| **Bone** | 140g | 10kg | Elemental Resistance - Fire |
| **Lamellar** | 110g | 15kg | **Noisy**. -1d6 to challenges related to sneaking |
| **Leather** | 110g | 15kg | **Stiff**. -2m to all movement |
| **Mail** | 150g | 30kg | **Noisy**. -2d6 to challenges related to sneaking |
| **Padded** | 80g | 15kg | **Warm**. +2d6 to checks against freezing |
| **Wood** | 100g | 20kg | **Noisy**. -2d6 to challenges related to sneaking |

### Heavy Armor

Heavy armor is the most extensive and protective form of armor. It generally uses the same layer of padding underneath which is used by medium armor, but then multiple layers of cloth, leather, and metal are placed over the top. Heavy armor is generally very strong, expensive, and unwieldy for anyone but trained users. Most heavy armor incorporates hardened metal plates into its design to protect the userâ€™s vitals, and this sometimes includes helmets which can lower visibility but offer incredible protection.

Heavy armor grants +3 to your resilience stat while being worn. Heavy armor can only be worn by medium and large characters.

Heavy armor reduces running speed by 2m and swimming speed by 5m.
