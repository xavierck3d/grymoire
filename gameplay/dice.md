# Dice

Grymoire uses d6 to determine the outcomes of various challenges in the game. The system is simple; the GM rolls a number of d6, and a player rolls a corresponding number to try and beat the sum of the GM’s roll.

Higher numbers of d6 rolled by the GM represent a greater degree of difficulty for a given task, and higher numbers of d6 rolled by the player represent a greater degree of proficiency by the player’s character. A single d6 rolled by the GM usually represents a fairly easy task, and a single d6 rolled by a player usually means they’re not very good at the skill required to succeed.
