# Checks, Challenges, Turns, and Rounds

Challenges are turn-based states in the game during which players and the GM take turns describing what they want to do, and roll a number of d6 to determine how successful they are. The GM declares when rounds begin and end based on what actions are currently taking place in the game. A round starts with whoever was the first to act in a given situation. If it’s unclear who acted first, everyone involved rolls a d6 and the person with the highest number goes first.

Turns proceed clockwise during a round.

During a round, the GM and players take turns until reaching the last person in the group. Once the round has completed, the GM determines the resolutions of all actions taken during that round, and then a new round proceeds once again in the same fashion.

Turns should all be thought of as happening simultaneously over a few seconds in the game world.

#### Turns

During a turn, you can move and take an action. Actions involve anything from casting a spell to shouting an insult at an enemy. At the GM’s discretion, you may be able to take more than one action during a turn as long as the actions aren’t very involved or time-consuming.

**Actions during a turn**

When you take an action during a turn, it can be almost anything as long as it takes no more than a few seconds. Actions include casting spells, speaking, assisting others, attacking, blocking

**Movement during a turn**

When you move during a turn, you are able to travel up to the maximum distance allowed for a creature of your size. For regular medium creatures moving at a walking pace, this is 10m.

Your movement can be broken up into multiple steps. You could, for example, move 5m, use an action to flip a switch, and then move another 5m during a single turn.

#### Checks

Whenever you roll dice, you’re rolling to check the result. You may be rolling to see your ability scores or rolling to see if you succeed or fail at a challenge. Regardless of why you’re rolling dice, this is referred to as a check.

#### Challenge Success and Failure

When you roll a check to see if you succeed or fail at a given challenge, you roll a number of d6 equal to your stat score for the given challenge’s stat type, and then add the result of all the dice together.

If the number you roll for the challenge is greater than or equal to the challenge difficulty set by the GM, you succeed.

Sometimes you’ll roll a check opposed to the GM or another player. For more information, see the Opposed Checks section later in this chapter.

#### Challenge Difficulty

The GM sets the difficulty score for any challenge. To do this, the GM picks a number of dice representing the difficulty, with smaller numbers of dice representing easier challenges, and larger numbers of dice representing more difficult challenges. As characters gain more power, they can take on more difficult challenges by rolling more dice.

**Difficulty Ratings**

In some cases, it’s faster and easier for the GM to simply set a difficulty rating using a specific number rather than rolling dice to determine the challenge difficulty. This can be done by using the average roll for a number of d6. The following table lists average difficulty ranges for various difficulty ratings.

| Difficulty | d6 | Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Effortless | 1d6 | 1 - 6 |
| Simple | 2d6 | 7 |
| Easy | 3d6 | 10 |
| Straightforward | 4d6 | 14 |
| Moderate | 5d6 | 17 |
| Tough | 6d6 | 21 |
| Difficult | 7d6 | 24 |
| Demanding | 8d6 | 28 |
| Challenging | 9d6 | 31 |
| Nearly impossible | 10d6 | 35 |

To set a difficulty rating using the table, the GM picks one of the numbers in the right column rather than rolling a large number of dice. As long as the player is able to beat the average for that difficulty rating, they succeed.

#### Skill Challenges

Skill challenges are events in the game when players roll one or more d6 to determine how successful they are at a specific skill. Skill challenges can be as simple as trying to catch an object someone threw, or as complex as solving a puzzle involving mechanical contraptions requiring input from multiple participants.

Challenges come in many forms, but all challenges involve players and the GM taking turns rolling dice which correspond to their stat proficiencies.

#### Multi-Part Skill Challenges

Some skill challenges require multiple steps to complete, and success or failure during one part of the challenge will determine the difficulty of subsequent parts of the challenge. For multi-part skill challenges, a failure will add 1d6 to the difficulty of subsequent parts, and a success will subtract 1d6 from subsequent parts.

In a hallway full of traps, failing to notice the first trap will make it 1d6 more difficult to dodge or detect the next traps. Successfully navigating past the first trap would lower the difficulty of moving past subsequent traps.

#### Combat

Combat consists of a series of challenge rolls involving attacking and defending against creatures who wish to do the player characters harm. Combat can also involve player versus player challenges.

#### Assisting

Characters can help one another with many challenges. If the GM determines that one or more characters can assist with a given challenge, each additional character assisting lowers the difficulty of the challenge by 1d6, to a minimum difficulty of 1d6 total.

#### Types of Challenges

There are an infinite number of types of challenges. Here are a few examples of challenge types, and the stats which would most likely be associated with them:

| Example Challenge | Stat | Example Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Solving a jigsaw puzzle | Mind | 2d6 |
| Lifting a collapsed cart off a child | Body | 5d6 |
| Dodging an arrow trap | Resilience | 4d6 |
| Hammering through a stone wall | Power | 8d6 |
| Holding onto a charging bull | Body | 6d6 |
| Navigating in stormy waters | Mind | 7d6 |
| Picking a simple lock | Mind | 2d6 |

### Opposed Checks

Many challenges involve two or more individuals competing with one another to achieve a goal. This could be anything from trying to beat someone in a footrace, to attempting to attack or block an attack from another creature.

In these situations, both parties make **opposed checks**.

#### Attacking and Blocking

Whenever you attack or block an attack, you check to see if you succeed. Attacking uses your power stat, and blocking uses your resilience stat.

To make an attack, roll 1d6 x your power stat.

To block or dodge an attack, roll 1d6 x your resilience stat.

#### Other Opposed Checks

Many instances of opposed checks have nothing to do with combat. Some spells require opposed checks to determine the results, and opposed checks are used in other situations such as sporting events, chases, and any competitive situation where skill or strategy are concerned.
