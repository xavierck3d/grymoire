# Humanfolk

Humanfolk tend to blend in with their environments very well, and each type tends to take on some aspect which separates them from each other. Still, humanfolk are still just humans, and relationships and marriages of different types of folk are very common

There are four basic types of humanfolk, each representing adaptations for their environments: nomads, elves, dwarves, and orcs.

### **Nomads**

The most common type of humanfolk, nomads roam the entire surface of the world and build small communities wherever they go. They never settle anywhere long enough to be strongly influenced by their environment. Because they are common everywhere, they are what most people think of when you say humanfolk. They have a wide variety of skin tones, facial features, heights, weights, politics, religions, and beliefs. Many nomads travel the world, and they make great adventurers. Nomads are excellent at pathfinding, cartography, and navigation, and they have an excellent inherent sense of direction.

> Weight: 45kg-145kg
>
> Natural senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, touch

> +1d6 to checks involving navigation, pathfinding, and cartography.
>
> Choose one from desertcraft, plainscraft, sailcraft, seacraft, spycraft, stonecraft, tundracraft, or woodcraft.

### **Elves**

Elves tend to be tall and lithe, with pointed ears and long lifespans. Many elves live in large, gracefully constructed cities. Elven settlements tend to be safe, secure, and focus on high art and magic. Elves come in a variety of skin tones, hair colors, and eye colors. It’s said that some elves share fae ancestry, and many people believe this is why some elves have fantastical hair and skin colors.

### **Dwarves**

Dwarves are the shortest and stockiest of humanfolk, owing to their origins in the most hazardous parts of the world. They are often thickly muscled, hairy, and well versed in the art of warfare. Dwarves tend to adorn themselves to blend with their environments, and most dwarven settlements are closer to large fortresses than normal cities. Despite their typically drab style, dwarves find gemstones and precious metals to be beautiful, and dwarven artisans are common.

Your dwarf ancestry grants the following statistics:

### **Orcs**

The largest and strongest of humanfolk, orcs tend to live in tribal societies and place a focus on martial prowess. Orcish folk tend to travel in large groups with tight-knit families and strong bonds between tribes. They generally have gray or greenish skin, pointed ears, and short noses. The tallest orcs stand head and shoulders above any of the other humanfolk, and can sometimes be seen riding bulls, direwolves, or elephants.

Your orc ancestry grants the following statistics:

> Size: large
>
> Speed: 12m walk/24m run/12m swim

>
> Choose one from desertcraft, plainscraft, sailcraft, seacraft, stonecraft, tundracraft, or woodcraft.

### **Mixed humanfolk**

Because they are all largely the same aside from minor visual and cultural differences, all humanfolk can procreate with one another. Many communities exist across the world in which mixed humanfolk are commonplace, and they often represent the best and most interesting parts of what makes their mixed ancestry unique.

There are a wide variety of mixed humanfolk, and no two are alike. When making a mixed humanfolk character, choose statistics from one of the nomad, elf, dwarf, or orc sections. For special abilities, choose one from the nomad, elf, dwarf, or orc special abilities sections.
