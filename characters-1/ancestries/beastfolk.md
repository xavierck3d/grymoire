# Beastfolk

Beastfolk are the most varied of all people and share characteristics with many different types of animals. There are near infinite variations of beastfolk, but the most common are: ursid, avian, catfolk, canid, and reptilia.

Beastfolk in general can be described by how humanoid they are, and this is usually broken into three categories: tame, feral, and wild.

Tame beastfolk usually look largely human, with an occasional animalistic trait such as small scales for skin, claws on the tips of their fingers, or more hair than normal.

Feral beastfolk usually look like a roughly even mix of human and animal traits. This often takes the form of humanoid bodies with fur or feathers, heads which strongly or entirely resemble animals, and animalistic hands and feet. Most feral beastfolk have tails, claws, and voices which resemble those of their animal counterparts.

Wild beastfolk are the most animalistic of all beastfolk, and can often be confused with their animal counterparts. They tend to look almost identical to animals, though they tend to walk upright, and are just as intelligent as other humanoids. Wild individuals often feel comfortable in the same environments as their animal counterparts, and sometimes leave society to live among their animal cousins. Wild avian, squamata, and others which resemble smaller creatures tend to be a little shorter than average human height.

**Ursid \(bear folk\)**

Ursid share characteristics with bears of all types. Most commonly, ursid are tall and thick, with strong muscles and hairy bodies. Wild ursid tend to be at least 2 meters tall, and their large claws are surprisingly nimble. Many ursid wear hides or thick woven smocks. Ursid tend to be fairly solitary. They are incredibly strong, and tend to be excellent hunters and trackers.

Some, such as the squamata who take after chameleons, have small eyes which can look in any direction, and tails which can act as a fifth limb. Those who take after skinks and common ground lizards tend to have the ability to distinguish the number, size, and disposition of nearby creatures just from the vibrations of their feet upon the ground.

**Ophid \(snake folk\)**

Ophid tend to be solitary, preferring to wander rather than setting down roots in any one specific place. All ophid tend to have long necks, snakelike heads, and scaled skin. They usually do not take well to strangers, and take a long time to warm up to anyone new. There are two general types of ophid; constrictors and vipers. Constrictors tend to be excellent at grappling, wrestling, and pinning opponents. Vipers, on the other hand, have a venomous bite which can paralyze or even kill those it strikes, but they tend to be less hardy than their constricting brethren.

Creatures 1 or more size classes smaller than you take 2d6 poison damage on the initial hit. Creatures 1 or more size classes larger than you take half poison damage from your venomous bite.

**Testudine \(tortoise folk\)**

Testudine are the most laid-back of reptile folk in general, and prefer to take life as it comes to them. They do very well in warm environments, and often like to take meandering paths as they march slowly to their destinations. Despite their slow gait and easy-going nature, testudine also boast some of the strongest natural defenses of all the reptilia, and all folk in general.

Usually soft-spoken and asocial, araneae tend to prefer the company of quiet individuals, and often take a liking to gnomes and their clean, subterranean dwellings.

All araneae have excellent vision and reflexes, and wild and beastly araneae retain the ability to create webs. These webs are usually not strong enough to trap anything but the smallest animals, but spider silk garments and tapestries are highly prized.

Some araneae work as fisher-folk, owing to their natural affinity for nets, weaving, and knots.
