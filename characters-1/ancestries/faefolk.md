# Faefolk

#### Faefolk

Faefolk often look much like humans, but they tend to be longer-lived, and have aspects which make them far more in tune with their environment than some other folk.

Though other types exist, there are three common types of faefolk, each having characteristics from the fae creatures that birthed them thousands of years ago: faeries, gnomes, and kobolds.

**Faeries**

Faeries tend to be lithe and graceful. They have pointed ears and small, butterfly-like wings with which they can glide for short distances. They tend to appreciate natural beauty and often adorn themselves and their homes with plants and flowers, and keep the company of wild creatures. Faeries often have improbably bright skin tones and hair in every color of the rainbow, and these colors sometimes even change with the seasons.

Your faerie ancestry grants the following statistics:

> Size: medium

>
> Weight: 30kg-90kg
>
> Natural senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, touch, darksight

Your faerie ancestry allows the following special abilities:

> Vibrant Soul – You have the ability to change your hair, skin, and eye color at will. This change takes at least 5 seconds.
>
> Woodcraft

**Gnomes**

Gnomes are short, hardy people. They tend to live underground in snug, comfortable abodes which they decorate with earth tones and varnished woods. Most gnomes are rather shy and tend to avoid congregating in groups. Most gnomes have an intuitive, almost magnetic sense for when precious gems and metals are nearby.

Your gnome ancestry grants the following statistics:

> Size: small
>
> Speed: 8m walk/16m run/8m swim
>
> Height: 0.5m-1m
>
> Weight: 5kg-25kg
>
> Natural senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, touch, darksight

Your gnome ancestry allows the following special abilities:

> Gilt Compass – You intuitively know the direction of the closest precious stone or piece of metal within 5m of your current location.

**Kobolds**

Kobolds are the smallest of the fae. They share many visual characteristics with gnomes, though they tend to change their appearance slightly to match their environments. Some superstitious folk view kobolds as good luck, and will often provide kobolds with free lodging. Many kobolds have an inherent understanding of illusion magic, and sometimes use this to hide in plain sight.

Your kobold ancestry grants the following statistics:

> Size: small
>
> Speed: 10m walk/20m run/10m swim
>
> Height: 0.25m-0.75m
>
> Weight: 2kg-15kg
>
> Natural senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, touch, darksight

Your kobold ancestry allows the following special abilities:

> Inherent Invisibility – Using inherent magic, you are able to hide yourself in plain sight in any conditions except direct sunlight. As long as you remain perfectly still, you can only be seen by creatures with magical sight.
