# Ancestries

People come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and this is especially evident in a character’s ancestry. Your character’s ancestry affects their appearance and can have an impact on various non-magical abilities, including the languages they speak, their physical strength, or their ability to see in the dark.

While ancestries grant you additional abilities, they do not make you more or less intelligent, or affect your morality in any way.

Ancestries are a result of the magics permeating the world since the dawn of time, and often represent a fusion of human and animal characteristics. Ancestries are broken down into three primary types: humanfolk, faefolk, and beastfolk. A fourth kind of ancestry, otherfolk, exists, though it’s largely a catch-all term for folk who do not fit into the above. All folk share some basic human characteristics, such as their senses, their intelligence, and their ability to cast magic spells. Faefolk, beastfolk, and otherfolk, however, have additional characteristics which make it evident that they’ve come from far lands or been influenced by powerful magic to take on new forms.
