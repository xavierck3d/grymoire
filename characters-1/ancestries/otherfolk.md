# Otherfolk

### **Demonfolk**

Demonfolk are humanoids whose blood can be traced to horned mischief-makers and otherworldly magic creatures with ambiguous motivations and often dark purposes.

Demonfolk have naturally occurring skin markings which may look like stripes, swirls, blotches, tattoos, or even scarification. Many of these markings resemble glyphs. Demonfolk skin colors vary widely, and are often almost parrotlike in their variety and vibrance.

All demonfolk have horns and a prehensile tail.

### **Dragonfolk**

Dragonfolk trace their lineage along ancient bloodlines, with ancestors being powerful dragons who took humanoid forms through magic. Dragonfolk tend to take after their dragon kin, and often enjoy high places with lots of open air. Many dragonfolk live in mountain enclaves where their communities are watched over by elder dragons who are sometimes thousands of years old. Dragonfolk are highly social, but tend to be difficult to read without having extensive experience with their kind.

### **Giantfolk**

Giantfolk are a group of large, strong, and versatile humanoids who tend to enjoy fairly solitary lifestyles in natural settings. Most giantfolk are not known for being especially intelligent, though they’re celebrated for their incredible physical strength and huge resilience against most types of damage. When they’re found in large settlements, many giantfolk find stable work as laborers, dockhands, and integral members of construction crews. In warfare they’re known to be strong and intimidating fighters. Giantfolk occasionally find success as prizefighters.

**Giants**

Giants resemble tall, heavyset humanfolk. Giants tend to be solitary creatures, only coming together to mate or, on occasion, hunt large prey. Most giants tend to have diets of exclusively meat. Many giants are known for their brute strength and unimpressive intellect, so most giants who make their way into civilization tend to be unusually intelligent for giant kind, and often feel at home with nomads. Fully grown giants are usually about ten feet tall, and incredibly strong.

As a giant, you have the following ability:

> Enhanced Giant Strength – You are able to lift four times your own weight without injuring yourself.

**Ogres**

Ogres are quite similar to giants in both build and intelligence, though ogres tend to congregate in groups much more often, and also usually enjoy an omnivorous diet. Family groups of ogres tend to live in swampy regions and build simple, sturdy dwellings from mud and fallen trees. Ogres have a variety of skin colors, though they’re usually gray, green, or bluish.

As an ogre, you have the following abilities:

> Homemaker – You feel comfortable in almost any natural setting and can make shelter out of nearly anything. +2d6 to finding or constructing shelter.
>
> Forager — +1d6 to checks involving finding food.

**Trolls**

Trolls are the most aggressive and solitary of giantfolk, only coming together for mating during the warm months. They tend to enjoy quiet caves near water, and are sometimes seen living under sturdy bridges where they fish and occasionally catch small animals for food.

As an ogre, you have the following ability:

> Limb Regrowth

**Ettins**

Ettins are a rare variety of conjoined giant with two to four heads, each having a personality of its own. Generally treated as outcasts, ettins tend to remove themselves from society and strike out on their own. As such, many of them speak only broken language, and feel more comfortable far from society.

As an ogre, you have the following abilities:

> Multi Headed – Having multiple heads makes it almost impossible to sneak up on you. +1d6 to passive resilience.
>
> Choose two from desertcraft, plainscraft, sailcraft, seacraft, stonecraft, tundracraft, or woodcraft.

### **Merfolk**

Merfolk hail from the oceans, lakes, and rivers of the world. Most merfolk closely resemble humans, though with fish-scaled skin and long-toed, webbed feet. Wild and beastly merfolk will sometimes lack legs altogether, and instead have fishlike fins.

Unlike most other folk, merfolk are capable of staying underwater indefinitely, and can swim at twice the rate of even the fastest land-dwelling folk.

Merfolk are highly social with their own kind, but tend to shy away from many terrestrial folk as they often come into conflict with land dwellers.

Your merfolk ancestry grants the following statistics:

> Size: medium
>
> Speed: 10m walk/20m run/30m swim
>
> Height: 1.1m-2.1m
>
> Weight: 45kg-145kg
>
> Natural senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, touch

Your merfolk ancestry allows the following special abilities:

> Water Breathing – You are able to stay underwater indefinitely without having to come up for breath.
>
> Watercraft

### **Mycofolk**

Mycofolk, or fungifolk, resemble various types of fungus, especially mushrooms. Most mycofolk are small and lightweight, about the same size as kobolds, and give off a pale green or bluish glow in the dark. Mycofolk tend to stick together, and find damp, dark places are where they’re most comfortable.

Mycofolk rarely wear clothing, though they adorn themselves lavishly with jewelry, makeup, body paint, tattoos, and scarification.

When a mycofolk individual is injured, they’re quick to heal, and can even regrow entire limbs over the course of about a week. Mycofolk are unique in that their severed limbs can also grow and sprout into an entirely new being independent of the original if given the right environment.

Mycofolk metabolisms are even slower than reptilia, and they will often go for weeks without eating so long as they have access to water.

Your mycofolk ancestry grants the following statistics:

> Size: tiny or small
>
> Speed: 10m walk/20m run/10m swim
>
> Height: 0.25m-0.75m
>
> Weight: 2kg-15kg
>
> Natural senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, touch, darksight

Your mycofolk ancestry allows the following special abilities:

> Cutting Clone – If one of your limbs is severed, it can be placed in a dark, damp environment and it will regrow into a copy of you with all the same traits and memories you had up to the moment it was severed from your body. This process takes one month. The new clone is indistinguishable from you aside from any scars, tattoos, etc.
>
> Enhanced Limb Regrowth – You are able to heal severed limbs in a week.

### **Plantfolk**

Plantfolk come in a dizzying variety of sizes and shapes, though the three main types are tree, flower, and vine plantfolk. All plantfolk enjoy being out in nature, and will sometimes seek out especially lush glades and forests where they can simply sit and enjoy being around plants.

Plantfolk are unique in that their physicality reflects the seasons and environment. During warm months, plantfolk become flexible and green, and they often sprout flowers and bright leaves where hair would be on people of other ancestries. As the weather cools, plantfolk tend to darken, and tree and vine plantfolk’s leaves turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. During winter, plantfolk often find themselves moving slower, and their coloration goes dark and woody.

**Flower folk**

Flower plantfolk are the most colorful and varied type of plantfolk. They tend to be slender and small, with vibrant petals where hair would usually go, and often enjoy being out in the sun. They are the shortest-lived of plantfolk, and sometimes only live a few years before retreating into nature to hide and sprout the next generation.

**Tree folk**

Tree folk are the longest lived of all plantfolk, sometimes living for hundreds or even thousands of years. Depending on which type of tree they take after, tree folk can be as large as a regular person, or taller than a house. Despite their height, tree folk all tend to be slow moving and methodical. What they lack in speed, however, they more than make up for in strength and resilience.

**Vine folk**

 Vine folk, while often mistaken for flower folk, lead very different lifestyles. Vine folk tend to prefer shady spots where they can spread out, both literally and metaphorically, and have the unusual ability to cling to walls and climb up them slowly. Of the three types of plantfolk, vine folk are the most likely to be found in urban environments, and are found just as often indoors as out.
