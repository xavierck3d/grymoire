# Characters

Characters in the world of Grymoire represent unique individuals who have been pulled into the world of adventuring through desire, necessity, or circumstance.

Character creation begins with determining your character’s stats. Stats determine how many dice you roll to try succeeding at various challenges.

Once your character’s stats are determined, you then pick an ancestry. Ancestries determine the physicality and some special abilities a character may possess.

After picking your character’s stats and ancestry, the final step is selecting your character’s spellcasting method. Your character’s spellcasting method determines whether they speak magic words or draw magic symbols to cast spells.

Once your character’s stats, ancestry, and spellcasting method have been determined, gameplay can begin.
