# The ability grid

The ability grid represents a character’s proficiency with various skills, as well as the glyphs they have locked in their mind to give them various bonuses to abilities.

Upgrading a character’s abilities is accomplished by trading glyph crystals they’ve acquired for abilities available to them based on their position on the glyph grid.

When a character trades an amount of crystal for an ability on the glyph grid, they remove that amount of crystal from their inventory as it is destroyed in the process of learning the new ability.

All characters start at the center of the glyph grid, and must pay some amount of crystal to move to a new location. Each space on the glyph grid will tell how much crystal it costs to move there, as well as which ability is earned by moving to that location.
