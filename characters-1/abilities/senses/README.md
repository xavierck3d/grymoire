# Senses

For more information on additional senses, see the ABILITIES section.

### Sight

Standard sight allows creatures to see sharply for about 50m before small details become very difficult to distinguish.

In dim light, such as during twilight, standard sight distance is halved to 25m.

In darkness, such as during a moonlit night, standard sight distance is reduced to 5m.

In perfect darkness, such as the inside of a cave, creatures with standard sight are considered blind.

Enhanced sight may allow for more acute vision, the ability to see heat, and more.

### Hearing

Standard hearing allows creatures to discern regular speech from 5m away in quiet conditions, or 1m away in noisy conditions such as a crowded tavern.

Enhanced hearing may allow for the ability to hear things from farther away, the ability to focus on specific sounds, and more.

### Smell

Standard smell allows creatures to pick out the scent of hot food from 5m away, and cold food from 0.5m away.

Standard smell allows creatures to smell a campfire from 1km away in dry conditions, or 100m away in rain.

Enhanced smell may allow for scent-based tracking, detection of specific compounds in the air, and more.

### Taste

Standard taste allows creatures to detect flavors such as sweet, salty, sour, or bitter in food or drink.

Enhanced taste may allow for detection of poisons and specific compounds in food, and more.

### Touch

Standard touch allows creatures to feel heat, cold, and various textures.

Enhanced touch may allow for the ability to read words on a page without looking, learning information about nearby movement via vibrations, and more.
