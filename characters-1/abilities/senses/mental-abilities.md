# Mental abilities

**Instant Insight**

Instant insight grants a creature faster analysis and examination of situations, allowing them to make split-second decisions where others would take time to deliberate.

At the start of any combat or challenge, take a turn as if it was your turn to go first. Play then proceeds as normal. If more than one creature in a given situation has instant insight, roll 1d6 to determine which goes first.

**Leonine Aspect**

Leonine aspect grants a creature a commanding presence, giving them greater influence over other creatures by nature of their charisma and strong leadership skills.

+1d6 to checks involving commanding, influencing, or charming other creatures

**Mind Atlas**

Mind atlas grants a creature the ability to accurately remember directions, maps, and paths of travel, as well as granting an uncanny sense of direction. Creatures with mind atlas can navigate in any compass direction within 5 degrees of accuracy even if they have not seen a map, compass, or known point of reference \(including familiar locations, landmarks, or celestial bodies\) within the past week. If a creature has not seen a familiar navigational aid for one week, the benefits of mind atlas fade, though the creature can still orient themselves relative to recently seen locations.
