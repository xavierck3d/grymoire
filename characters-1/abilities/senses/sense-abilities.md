# Sense abilities

Sense abilities are abilities based on a creature’s senses, such as sight, hearing, or touch. Sense abilities grant creatures greater sense acuity, or the capability to discern things with their senses that most others cannot.

**Bloodhound’s Nose**

Bloodhound’s nose grants a creature the ability to accurately identify objects and creatures by scent. A creature with bloodhound’s nose can detect if a creature, object, or substance has been in an area within the past week in clear weather, within the past day in windy or snowy weather, or within the past hour in rainy weather. Bloodhound’s nose can be overwhelmed with strong scents as long as the cause of the scent was applied or activated no more than one hour ago.

**Darksight**

Darksight grants a creature the ability to see clearly in near perfect darkness. As long as there is even the slightest hint of light, a creature with darksight can see half their regular distance in the dark \(rounded down\), or their regular distance in low light. In dark conditions, a creature with darksight sees the world in shades of gray, and in full color during low light conditions. Creatures with darksight are unable to see in perfect darkness, such as the inside of a cave, a darkened cellar, or in magical darkness.

**Discerning Palate**

Discerning palate grants a creature the ability to accurately identify compounds by taste. A creature with discerning palate can detect any compound it is familiar with, and can also identify instantly if a compound such as poison is present in anything it tastes.

**Heatsight**

Heatsight grants a creature the ability to distinguish shapes and movement using only heat. Warmer objects appear as orange tones, and cool objects seem to fade to black. Heatsight grants limited ability to see through thin materials such as tent canvas, but objects behind obstructions are indistinct and only general shapes are visible. Heatsight cannot perceive anything through more than two sheets of thick fabric, wood thicker than 1cm, or through any stone barrier.

**Heatsight - Passive**

Some creatures, such as ophid, have a passive form of heatsight which grants them greater sensitivity to heat in their environment, but is not true sight in that it does not use their eyes. Creatures with passive heatsight can only discern direction and temperature, and only within about 5 meters.

**Longsight**

Longsight grants a creature the ability to see much farther and more clearly than normal. Creatures with longsight can see twice as far as standard creatures. Creatures with longsight cannot see through obstructions any more than creatures with normal sight.

**Second Sight**

Second sight grants a creature the ability to perceive beyond the material and into the space between spaces, showing evidence of supernatural effects. A creature with second sight can see afterimages of magic use, births, deaths, and world-changing events as long as they are within 10m of the original location in which any of these events took place.

Afterimages fade over time, and may become imperceptible after enough time has passed.

**Touchsight**

Touchsight grants a creature the ability to learn various things about any object it touches by feeling the object’s surface. A creature with touchsight can accurately describe the size and shape of an object of which it is able to touch one or more surface, and can even read written words on a page using only touch.

**Tremblesense**

Tremblesense grants a creature the ability to accurately measure the direction, approximate size, and approximate number of creatures or objects causing vibrations in an object or surface while the creatures or objects are no more than a kilometer away.

**Watersight**

Watersight grants a creature the ability to peer through any water as if it were clear as air. Even the murkiest or foamiest water appears as no more than a slight haze. Creatures with watersight are still able to perceive reflections in water if they wish. Watersight does not grant any ability to see in dark conditions, and the bottom of a murky lakebed would still be quite dark in comparison to the air above it.

**Wolf’s Ear**

Wolf’s ear grants a creature incredibly sensitive hearing. Creatures with wolf’s ear are able to pick out individual voices in a crowd from up to 10 meters away, and can accurately hear speech through up to 10 centimeters of stone.
