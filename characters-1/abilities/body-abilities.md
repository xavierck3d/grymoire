# Body abilities

**Camouflage**

Camouflage grants a creature the uncanny ability to hide with minimal effort or preparation, even in areas where it would normally be almost impossible to hide. Camouflage allows a creature to stay still in uncomfortable positions for longer than usual.

**Elemental Resistance**

Elemental resistance grants a creature resistance to one or more types of elemental damage. These damage types are air, earth, fire, and water. For situations in which multiple types of elemental damage are applied from the same source, the damage reduction effect is halved.

Reduce air, earth, fire, or water elemental damage you take by half \(rounded down\)

**Fifth Limb**

You have a tail which can grasp small objects and hold onto handholds to keep you stable. The tail is not dexterous enough to perform fine motor actions such as writing, but with training it can perform actions such as catching small thrown objects or turning door handles.

**Flight**

Flight grants a creature the ability to fly using wings or magical means. Creatures with flight cannot stay aloft forever, and must remain in motion unless specified.

**Giant Strength**

Giant strength grants a creature greater than usual strength, owing to intense physical conditioning, size, or musculature. Creatures with giant strength are able to lift twice their own body weight without injury.

**Glide**

Glide grants a creature the ability to launch from a point and glide forward for a distance. For every 5m traveled while gliding, a creatureâ€™s altitude decreases by 2m. While gliding, a creature has only minimal control of its trajectory, and cannot adjust its target landing area by more than 2m to the left or right.

While gliding, a creature does not touch the ground, and any effects which rely on their being in contact with the ground do not take effect until they land.

**Limb Regrowth**

Limb regrowth grants a creature the ability to heal and regrow severed arms, legs, or tails as long as the same limb does not take additional damage during the healing process. This process takes three months and requires eating three full meals every day. Failing to eat three full meals every day will result in the limb regrowth taking 1 additional day per missed meal.

**Nimble Hands**

Nimble hands grants a creature greater than usual manual dexterity, making it easier to accomplish tasks such as lockpicking, juggling, and balancing objects in their hands.

**Poison Resistance**

Poison resistance grants a creature an improved resistance to the effects of poison.

**Resilience**

Resilience grants a creature greater toughness and the ability to withstand physical discomfort, including pain, extreme heat and cold, and other conditions during which a creature would normally start to take damage after a set amount of time.

Every 24 hours, you are able to resist ambient environmental damage for an additional 1d6 units of time \(minutes, hours, etc.\) specified by the individual damage type.

**Slow Metabolism**

Slow metabolism grants a creature a slower than usual metabolic rate, reducing their need for food and giving them greater natural resilience against starvation. Creatures with slow metabolism do not need to eat more than once per week, and can survive for up to two months without food. Creatures with slow metabolism are at a greater risk of freezing to death because of their slow bloodflow.
