# Abilities

There are a wide variety of abilities available to characters. Some of these abilities are inherent based on the characterâ€™s ancestry or background, and some are learned through experience and practice.

There are three general categories of abilities: sense abilities, body abilities, mental abilities.

Each ability has a description, and some will also have text which describes a specific effect which can alter how certain challenges work for the creature or character with the ability.
