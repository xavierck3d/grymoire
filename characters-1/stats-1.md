# Stats

Whenever they face a challenge, players roll a number of d6 equal to their character’s proficiency in a given stat. The GM determines which stat a challenge will use. As a character gains proficiency in certain areas, a corresponding stat will go up to reflect that they are more capable in that area.

Higher stats give opportunities to roll more dice for challenges that rely on those stats, making players more likely to succeed.

Each stat corresponds to a different set of actions and abilities:

#### Mind

The mind stat corresponds to any challenges having to do with your intelligence, memory, wisdom, street smarts, charm, or general mental and emotional abilities. Actions and challenges that use the mind stat include solving a puzzle, comprehending a riddle, having an argument, flirting with a romantic interest, learning a language, or reading a map.

#### Body

The body stat corresponds to any challenges having to do with your physical endurance, toughness, health, strength, or general physical abilities. Actions and challenges that use the body stat include running a long distance before tiring, lifting a heavy object, withstanding the effects of a poison, or using your senses of sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste.

#### Resilience

The resilience stat corresponds to any challenges having to do with dodging attacks, protecting yourself from physical damage, and enduring physical or magical injury. Actions and challenges that use the resilience stat include dodging a falling boulder, surviving a hit from a fire spell, or batting an enemy’s weapon out of the way.

#### Power

The power stat corresponds to any challenges having to do with attacking, dealing damage, or utilizing offensive weaponry or spells. Actions and challenges that use the power stat include attacking with a weapon, using any damage-dealing spells, or aiming at a target with an item, weapon, or spell.

#### Determining Stats

To determine your stat proficiency scores, roll 5d6 and disregard the lowest roll. Assign the numbers as you like according to how proficient you would like your character to be with mind, body, resilience, and power.

#### Stats and Abilities

Some abilities grant you additional d6 which you can use to overcome certain types of challenges. Any ability will tell you which stat it affects, and how it can be used.

For more information on abilities, check the ABILITIES section.

#### Passive Stats

Passive stats are properties inherent in a creature’s physicality, and are governed by the Mind, Body, Power, and Resilience stats, as well as ancestry and learned abilities.

**Hit Points**

Hit points represent how much physical and magical damage a creature is able to withstand before being knocked out. Alternately, for more deadly games, they may be a representation of how many times a character can cheat death before their luck runs out. In the latter case, they can be thought of as Heroism Points.

Initial hit points are equal to 1d6 + the Body stat.

**Swimming and Holding Breath**

Average swimming speed is about 1.5m per second, or about 10m per round.

You are able to hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to half your body stat rounded down, to a minimum of 1 minute.

**Size**

Creatures come in a variety of sizes, from miniscule to gargantuan. The size table shows about how large the different size classes are.
